A Kalman filter is implemented in KPE to fuse IMU and GPS information. The filter estimates the short-range and long-rage positions simultaneously with the combination of the GPS data and IMU orientation information. We considered Kalman filter for sensor fusion which provides accurate position estimation despite of noise and drift. We have also performed the field trials to demonstrate the usability of the developed KPE. Evaluation of proposed solution through experiments in indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating the position accuracy with few centimeters for short-range positioning and within a meter for long-range positioning."},{"name":"Design of a Cost-Effective Remote Health Monitoring System Using IoT","publisher":"Springer Nature Singapore","releaseDate":"2023-03-01","url":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-2710-4_11","summary":"An IoT-based health monitoring system is developed by which a patient at a remote location can be monitored 24x7 without any family member or health staff and updates the health data in real time using the Internet. The health monitoring system uses an Arduino board, a MAX30102 sensor, and a website. After attaching to a fingertip, the sensor senses the patient’s body temperature and heart rate and sends that to the Arduino board for conversion to digital forms. Arduino board converts the health data to digital format and uploads the real time data to a database. The website uses an authentication and authorization process to verify whether the user is valid. After proper validation, it shows health data on the website according to the role of the logged user. One can monitor a patient’s health data with this device from anywhere in the world, having an Internet connection."},{"name":"VLSI Implementation of Neural Network Based Emergent Behavior Model for Robot Control","publisher":"IEEE","releaseDate":"2022-10-14","url":"https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Die_Grundlage_der_allgemeinen_Relativitätstheorie","summary":"This paper reports the VLSI implementation of NN (N eural N etwork) based emergent behavior model for high-speed robot control. Augmented FSM (F inite-S tate M achine) is considered to implement the emergent behavior. We performed a system level simulation using our proposed model. Then, we transformed the model to RTL (R egister-T ransfer L evel) for circuit simulation. In this study, we considered multiple-inputs and multiple-outputs NN. Our implementation method improves speed of execution and accuracy and compare the result with conventional neural network. For activation function in NN, we implemented sigmoid function with second order approximation to educe complexity. We used walking gesture of Kondo KHR-3HV robot to verify the model."}],"skills":[{"name":"Physics","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Bengali","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Physics","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"references":[{"name":"Professor John Doe","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
