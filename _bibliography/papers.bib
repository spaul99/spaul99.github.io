  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	title={Accurate Kinematic-Parameters Estimation Using IMU and GPS Sensors Fusion},

	pages={35547-35554},
	abstract={In this work, we developed a kinematic parameters estimator (KPE) using global positioning system (GPS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors embedded with a microcontroller. A Kalman filter is implemented in KPE to fuse IMU and GPS information. The filter estimates the short-range and long-rage positions simultaneously with the combination of the GPS data and IMU orientation information. We considered Kalman filter for sensor fusion which provides accurate position estimation despite of noise and drift. We have also performed the field trials to demonstrate the usability of the developed KPE. Evaluation of proposed solution through experiments in indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating the position accuracy with few centimeters for short-range positioning and within a meter for long-range positioning.},
